# 4-Week GenAI Roadmap for Java Developers

Are you a Java developer who feels left out in the AI revolution?
This roadmap is for you.

> Master Generative AI and Agentic AI fundamentals using your existing Java skills—without switching to full-time data science or Python.

## 🚀 Week 1: Mindset Shift + GenAI Basics

**Goal:** Understand the AI landscape and get your first GenAI app running.

### 🔹 What to Learn
- What is AI vs ML vs GenAI vs Agentic AI?
- How LLMs work: Transformers, embeddings, tokenization
- Prompt Engineering 101
- Java + OpenAI API integration (use OkHttp, Feign, or RestTemplate)

### 🔹 Hands-on Tasks
- Sign up for [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) and get an API key
- Try a basic API call using Postman and then Java
- Build: A Java console app that chats using ChatGPT

## ⚙️ Week 2: Prompt Engineering & Integration

**Goal:** Go deeper into prompt design and use Java to interact with GenAI more powerfully.

### 🔹 What to Learn
- Prompt techniques: zero-shot, few-shot, system instructions
- Streaming completions
- Calling OpenAI from Spring Boot (LangChain4j or plain REST)

### 🔹 Hands-on Tasks
- Build a Spring Boot REST API that accepts a prompt and returns AI response
- Add Swagger UI for testing
- Bonus: Use LangChain4j to build chains of prompts

## 🤖 Week 3: Agentic Workflows

**Goal:** Learn how to use agents that plan and act—using or integrating with Java.

### 🔹 What to Learn
- What are agents? Tools, memory, and planning
- Frameworks: LangChain, CrewAI, LangGraph
- Java+Python bridges: Use REST or gRPC to call agents from Java

📺 **Video:** [LangChain Agents - The Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4mN9W7QO0E) by LangChain

### 🔹 Hands-on Tasks
- Build: A Java app that sends user intent to a Python agent and gets result
- Build: An agent that reads folder of PDFs and summarizes contents

### 🔹 Resources
- [LangChain Agents Overview](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/)
- [CrewAI Docs](https://docs.crewai.com/)

## 🧠 Week 4: Build Your AI Product

**Goal:** Build a complete project using Java + GenAI

### 🔹 Project Idea
**Intelligent Document Summarizer Web App**
- Upload a PDF
- Extract text using Java libraries (e.g. PDFBox)
- Send to OpenAI
- Return summary + suggestions

### 🔹 Tech Stack
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
- Frontend: Thymeleaf or React
- AI: OpenAI API

### 🔹 Stretch Goals
- Add memory using Redis or PostgreSQL
- Add feedback loop: thumbs-up/down + comment
